\section*{Abstract} Partial differential equations exhibiting multi-scale behavior are notoriously difficult to approximate numerically. In the functional analysis setting the issue is often characterized by a loss of discrete stability (coercivity) of the bilinear form in question. We develop a continuous Petrov Galerkin method that provides a stable and accurate solution in a norm of choice. This is achieved by computing compactly supported continuous test-functions that are the solution to a small local adjoint problem in an enriched space subject to a projector of choice. This enriched space can be interpreted as a discretization of the fine scale space in the variational multi-scale setting and the projector provides the scale separation between the coarse scale space and the fine scale space in the chosen norm. A couple of univariate advection diffusion problems show the efficacy of the proposed methodology for a $C^0$ Petrov Galerkin scheme based the $H^1_0$-semi-norm.
