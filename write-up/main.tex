\section*{Abstract} Partial differential equations exhibiting multi-scale behavior are notoriously difficult to approximate numerically. In the functional analysis setting the issue is often characterized by a loss of discrete stability (coercivity) of the bilinear form in question. We develop a continuous Petrov Galerkin method that provides a stable and accurate solution in a norm of choice. This is achieved by training a class of properly chosen functions such that their action resembles that of optimal test functions, which follow the solution of a local adjoint problem. This approach is akin to a multidimensional construction of streamline upwind Petrov Galerkin, taking into account all properties of the local flow field.
